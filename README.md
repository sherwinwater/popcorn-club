# Popcorn Club

[View Demo here](https://popcorn-club.netlify.app/)

A redesigned and refactored movie library built with React JS using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). For an older version, take a look [here](https://github.com/yumietzk/popcorn-club-old).  
Users can search movies and TV shows and get data by different genres and categories. Users can also see a movie and TV showâ€™s details, trailer, and official webpage.  
I implemented Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication. When users sign in, they can save their favorite movies and TV shows. I created a rest api with JSON Server run on Heroku to save and fetch data stored in favorite section.

## Features

- Search and sort data by categories
  ![Search by category](./assets/searchByCategory.gif)
  Users can search data by changing genres and sort data by title name, release date and rating. Users can also decide how many data they want to get.

- See detail
  ![See detail](./assets/seeDetail.gif)
  Users can see the detail of movies and TV shows such as a preview video, a website, casts, reviews and related shows. Users can also jump to a detail page of casts. And more to explore!

- Search
  ![Search](./assets/search.gif)
  Users can search both movies and TV shows related to a term submitted in a search input.

- Sign In & Sign Out
  ![Sign in](./assets/sigin.gif)
  After users sign in, they can save their favorite movies or TV shows, and can see the data in a favorite page. Without signing in, a favorite heart button which users can click and save its data doesn't show up and they can't save data.
